After several months of evening development, the first version 1.0.0 of the Base64 File plugin has been completed. This
version has been submitted to [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) for review before its release. It will be
published in the beta channel,
meaning it won't be available on the [Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/) but will be accessible for download
from a special repository.
