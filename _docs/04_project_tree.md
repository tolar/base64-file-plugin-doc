## Encode File

The user can encode a selected file in the project tree by invoking the appropriate action from the context menu.

{% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/screenshot/project_tree/tree_overview_action.png" %}

### Encode And Insert Action

| Action                     | Description                                                                                              |

| Encode and Insert at Caret | The action inserts the encoded file selected in the project tree into the editor at the cursor position. |

## Link Visualisation

Links between files and their encoded values are visually represented in the project tree.

{% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/screenshot/project_tree/tree_overview_gui_elements.png" %}

If the user clicks on a link added by the plugin in the project tree, the file that the link points to is selected in the project tree.
